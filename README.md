# vivino-challenge

This project contains the code for the [Coding Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRVAUmTQOEXPlLLRManetX9PCgxa58I98dc8YPYMa8ddmzdBty34E2pV2OICkTMY7Z7JgAI2Esz0gjS/pub?urp=gmail_link) for Vivino.

The end product should, and does look more or less like the following image.

**This was FUN! ;)**

The code isn't perfect, or even finished, but works, and fulfills all/most of the requirements. The development had not been a marathon, and had been done in a chill manner over ~2.24 days.
Each of the first 4 commits took more or less 30-60 minutes to implement. While the latter 4 commits took a few minutes and were mostly cleanup. This brings the **total time spent on this project to around ~4 hours** of real work.

## How to run

Please have **node** installed and use the **npm** package manager.

Because of time, I have only ran and tested this on **Google Chrome** in desktop mode.

At the root of the project...

`npm install`

`npm run start`

The following web-app should open running on `localhost` on port **3000**

(if it doesn't for some reason, please write me at **piotr.zywien@gmail.com** or call me at **53 54 41 89**)

## Tech

- NPM for package management
- WebPack for bundling
- Babel for compiling
- React for building
- TypeScript for typing
- CSS for styling
- CSS Modules for the scoping of styling

## Assumptions

I've made a number of assumptions and design choices for this project, as I figured I had no real substantive questions (bar one), and didn't feel the need to have a back-and-forth email conversation when it could have been avoided.
These assumptions and design choices apply to this project only, as this is an *exercise*, and not a real-world task. Hence, I opted for brevity and creativity; which made it more fun.

These are the following liberties I had taken:

- The fonts, colors, styles, have been inspired by the design provided, however, liberties, estimations and approximations were made, as no precise design (i.e. Figma) was provided.
- The UX and the way the flow by which the user interacts with the UI were not specified, so I mocked up something that made more or less sense to me.
- Since this is an exercise, and it wasn't a requirement, the UI is not responsive, nor is it mobile-first. This is the type of optimization that would be nice to implement in the future.
- The number or records matched are more than those displayed, so I assume the API has pagination support, however this wasn't a requirement of the exercise so I saw no need to ask about it. Should be a next step though.

Should you have any questions about my choices, please feel free to ask! :)

## Possible next steps

Since this was just an exercise, this is by no means a production-ready project. Also the feature is not "production-ready", per se.
The following are the next steps that could be taken given more time, more precise specifications, should the need aris.

- Collaboration with a UI/UX designer to specify more precisely and nail down the requirements of this app
- Optimisation and minification of code for efficiency
- Implementing pagination for iterating through the wines
- Writing the UI in a mobile-first responsive manner, so it could be viewed well on handheld devices
- Testing and debugging on other browsers.
- Cleaning up code, using Prettier and ESLint for beautiful and compliant code

## See you tomorrow! ;-)

That's about it! If there are any questions you have, please do not hesitate to write me at **piotr.zywien@gmail.com** or call me at **53 54 41 89**; otherwise, I'll see you tomorrow at the interview! ;)

Thanks sincerely, and I look forward to talking to you tomorrow. See you! :)

**Piotr.**
